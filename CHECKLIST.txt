	+ Null generator: Fully implemented

Ideas
------

- We should do a validator as well OR
- Are there any usable validators out there? (we should search for them).

- Given a validator we could generate data for some additional types of
  generators as well, the ones where we have a generation part, 
  and a restriction part (similar to ?SUCHTHAT). 
  Similarly to ?SUCHTHAT this will not be efficient, but at least
  doable.
