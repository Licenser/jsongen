** JSONGEN CHECKLIST **

	+ Array type: template type not implemented (do we need it?)

	+ Array type: 'unique' keyword is implemented but json specification is not very clear describing its behaviour. 
	  Maybe it doesn't do what is really inteded to do

	+ Use 'frequency' EQC library function in anyType() function call (jsongen module). Right now its a mess

	+ Documentation and specification

Ideas
------

- We should do a validator as well ==> *DONE*
- Are there any usable validators out there? (we should search for them).

- Given a validator we could generate data for some additional types of
  generators as well, the ones where we have a generation part, 
  and a restriction part (similar to ?SUCHTHAT). 
  Similarly to ?SUCHTHAT this will not be efficient, but at least
  doable.
