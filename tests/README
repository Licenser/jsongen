Put schemas here that should be used for testing.
A schema should have a suffix ".jsch" to be recognized by the
tester function.

A schema may contain a property "empty", which should be either true or
false, which determines whether it should be possible to generate a value
from the schema or not.

In the case when empty is true just a single value is generated.
In the case when empty is false 10 values are generated.

To run this "tests" execute
erl -pa ebin -run rtest test -run erlang halt
