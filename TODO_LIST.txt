List of things to do or change

** TO DO NEXT **

1) String pattern implementation (Seems more complex than the rest of string implementation. It will take some time)



** COMPLETED **

-> String generator values are really small (Usually between two and four chars.
When using 'minLength' keyword, most of the instances generated have that 
length. The best solution would be to modify the generator implementation). 
Fixed

-> Problem with formats when encoding between erlang and json. String values have to be passed to mochi as binaries. Fixed
