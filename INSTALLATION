PREREQUISITES
=============

An installation of Erlang, and, to use jsongen, having the mochijson2 library
installed (see https://github.com/bjnortier/mochijson2).

COMPILATION
===========

To compile the jsongen library it normally suffices to execute 
``configure" and then ``make'' in the main directory.  In the following 
we assume that you are using a UNIX based system:

$ ./configure; make; make examples

===============================================

Installation as a normal Erlang library:

===============================================

As an alternative to including the path to the jsongen ebin
directory in calls to erlang (e.g., erl -pa jsongen/ebin), or
adding the jsongen directory to the environment variable ERL_LIBS,
one can install jsongen as a normal Erlang library. Steps:

1. Compile jsongen as above, and then
   make release

2. Install jsongen as a library:
   cd release/jsongen_version*

   erl
   1> jsongen_install:install().

For the last step to work, it may be necessary to start Erlang (erl)
with super-user rights (under Unix) or administrator rights (Windows).

More information regarding how to install jsongen as a library,
including from a pre-compiled jsongen distribution, can be found in
the file bininst/INSTALLATION.
